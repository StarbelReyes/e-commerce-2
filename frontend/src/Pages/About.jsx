            Welcome to HI + HE, a clothing brand inspired by a profound sense of purpose and divine calling. Our name, which stands for <strong>Humility in Human Endeavors</strong>, is a tribute to the timeless lessons of the Tower of Babelâ€”a reminder that, without divine guidance and blessing, even our most ambitious efforts can lead to confusion and discord.
